        <h1>Recreation</h1>
        <p>Iranians spend much of their leisure time visiting one another and entertaining friends and relatives in their homes. They also enjoy a variety of sports, including basketball, soccer, volleyball, and weightlifting. Many men practice a traditional form of weightlifting exercises and gymnastics at athletic clubs called a zurkhaneh. The word zurkhaneh means house of strength. Live theater, motion pictures, and television are becoming increasingly popular, especially among young people in the cities.
Iranians celebrate many religious and national holidays. A major holiday is Nowruz, the Iranian New Year. Nowruz begins on the first day of spring. Fifteen days before the new year starts, most families plant wheat or lentil seeds in a shallow bowl. The green sprouts that appear symbolize the coming of spring. On New Year's Eve, families gather for elaborate banquets. People spend the first few days of the Nowruz holidays visiting nearby friends and relatives. On the 13th day of the new year, the last day of the Nowruz celebration, almost all Iranians go on picnics.
